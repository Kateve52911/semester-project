# Community Science Museum

![image]

I set out to create a web page for a community science museum using HTML and CSS. It is meant to be enganing for children while at the same time informative for parents and caregivers of the children.

## Description

This is a project I created as a student at Noroff as my semester project. This my attempt at creating a website that both followed the WCAG rules while at the same time being inviting and eyecatching to children. It is a website that is built and designed to provide an engaging user experience.

This is to showcase skill in frond-end development. Such as:

- HTML & CSS: Structured and styled the website to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- Web Design: Applied principles of user-centered design to create intuitive navigation and layout.
- Content Organization: Effectively organized information across multiple pages to enhance user engagement.
- Version Control: Utilized GitHub for version control and project management.
